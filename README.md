iTuner
------

A utility that interfaces with iTunes to provide additional functionality that
was missing at the time. It sits in the notification area to do the following:

- Show notification popups when songs are played with album art and song info
- Hotkeys to show/hide iTune, play next or previous song, and other behaviors
- Logs radio/streamed tracks, noting which songs are currently in the library
- Adds the option to stop playing music just after the current track finishes
